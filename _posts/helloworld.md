## Logbook entry 1
--
I am Valentin, a Junior Web Developer trained at the Wild Code School.
Curious about everything, but above all passionate about audiovisual, IT and new technologies from a very young age, I decided to embark on development
If I am a web developer today, know that it was not always the case, a former soldier in an elite unit I made the choice to change my life.
I therefore carried out a skills assessment which confirmed my idea of ​​moving towards digital professions and more specifically web development. So I embarked on an intensive training as a web developer. 5 intense months which allowed me to acquire a solid foundation, to learn good practices and to understand good methodologies in order to be able to continue to progress.
