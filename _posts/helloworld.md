## Logbook entry 1
--
I am Valentin, a Junior Web Developer trained at Wild Code School. I’m curious about everything, but I’m passionate about audiovisual, IT and new technologies in particular since a very young age. If I am a web developer today, know that it was not always the case : being a former soldier from an elite unit, I made the choice to change my life. I therefore carried out a skills assessment which confirmed my idea of moving towards a digital profession and more specifically web development. That is why I have embarked on a rigorous training as a web developer. Five intense months allowed me to acquire strong basis on web development, to learn good practices and to understand good methodologies to continue to progress.
