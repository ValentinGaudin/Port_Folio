First educational project within Wild. After two weeks of studying the basics of development, we had to train our four-man team to develop our first static application. We decided to create a showcase site for the city of Lyon, following these few guidelines:

1.Static website in HTML & CSS 
2.Responsive design: Real reflection on display, not just element resizing. 
3.Visual consistency: The pages do not have different graphic style. 
4.Correct presentation of the project with contextualization: "Why was this site developed" 
5.Collaborative teamwork and management of possible first human conflicts 
6.Basic use of Git / GitHub and early code conflicts. We are rather proud of the result.
