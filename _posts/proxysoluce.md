Second project within Wild. In six weeks we have to do a project with PHP and the simple MVC for the conception. 
With that we have a customer, **fictitious customer**. Let's get back to the list of tools we have develop.

1. Responsive webSite. 
2. Database with MySQL and relationship, conception with MVC. 
3. Registration and securisation of data like password (hash)
4. Basic CRUD informations.
5. Collaborative teamwork and management, trello, product backlog and MoSCoW prioritization.
6. Relation with client, SCRUM method, Product Owner and set a Scrum Lead.
7. Basic use of Git / GitHub.
8. Correct presentation of the project with contextualization: "Why was this site developed".

Do not hesitate to see the repository link on GitHub.
